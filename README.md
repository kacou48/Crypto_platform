# TO LAUCH A DJANGO PROJECT LOCALLY FROM THE TERMINAL, YOU CAN THESE STEPES.
1 Open a terminal or command prompt.
2 Navigate to the root directory of your Django project using the cd command. For example, if your project is located in a folder named "myproject," you would use the following command: cd path/to/myproject

3 Activate your virtual environment if you are using one. If you are not using a virtual environment, you can skip this step. Depending on the virtual environment tool you are using (e.g., virtualenv), the activation command may vary. Here are a few examples: source venv/bin/activate

4 Make sure you have all the necessary dependencies and requirements installed for your Django project to run successfully. If you encounter any errors or issues, please provide more details so that I can assist you further: pip install -r requirements.txt

4 Once you are in the project directory and the virtual environment is activated, you can run the Django development server using the manage.py script that comes with Django. Use the following command: python manage.py runserver

5 The development server should start running, and you will see output similar to the following: 
Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
Quit the server with CONTROL-C.

7 Open a web browser and visit the URL http://127.0.0.1:8000/ or http://localhost:8000/. You should see your Django project running locally.

Note: By default, the Django development server listens on port 8000. If you want to use a different port, you can specify it when running the server by adding the port number after the runserver command, like this: python manage.py runserver 8080
